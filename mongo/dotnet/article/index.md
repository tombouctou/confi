# MongoDB as .NET Configuration Provider

> Building Custom Configuration Provider to Read Configuration from MongoDB in an ASP .NET Core App.

An ASP .NET Core app comes with multiple built-in Configuration Sources such as `appsettings.json`, environment variables, and command-line arguments. Unfortunately, neither of them provides a convenient way to update a configuration value on the fly. Things get especially complex with distributed systems where we need to update the settings just once and get them propagated to multiple application instances.

We need a database! MongoDB is JSON-based, so it comes with a dynamic schema and resemblance to appsettings.json - let's use it. All that's left to do is to build our MongoDB Configuration Provider.

## TLDR;

We've built a custom MongoDB configuration provider. The same provider could be found in a package, called `Confi.Mongo`. Here's how you can register one:

```csharp

```

After the registration, values of `simple` and `toggles` documents from the `configurations` collection will be automatically loaded to the  `IConfiguration`, which is all we need to do to integrate with the .NET configuration system.

The package is part of a [confi project](https://github.com/astorDev/confi), providing various configuration tools and best practices. Don't hesitate to give it a star! ⭐
