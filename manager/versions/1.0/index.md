## Consumer Sync

- [ ] Consumer Reads Current Configuration.
- [ ] Consumer Self-Declared with an Up-To-Date Configuration

#### Is Consumer Sync a Sequential or Parallel Operation?

- Does consumer sync is one operation or smth done in parallel
    - Benefits for parallel
        - If node push breaks consumer will still get an up to date info
        - Can use simply `AddJsonHttp`
        - Sync intervals can be configured separately
            - In sequential case we can make `PUT /nodes` run once in x (2/3) configuration reads
    - Benefits for sequential
        - Normally no outdated state push
        - ‚≠ê Allows `Syncing` status (`node.updatedAt` is before (<) `configuration.updatedAt`) - no `unsynced` status in normal flow
